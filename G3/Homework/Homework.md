# Burger App üçî

## Summary

A small burger shop wants a web app that can offer simple ordering of burgers. Since they don't know if the idea will work, they need a small prototype to get started.  

## Part 1
The first part of the implementation will be to create appropriate domain models and setup a "database" that will be a **Static list** in the first place.
Taking that into consideration here are the models that we will need for the burger shop application  

## Business Domain Information

Users will not be part of the prototype at this moment. Here is some business domain information:

* Burger
  * Name
  * Price
  * IsVegetarian
  * IsVegan
  * HasFries
* Order
  * FullName
  * Address
  * IsDelivered
  * Burgers
  * Location ( String )

## Bonus
Considering the previous information, think about the Controllers and try to implement some in the application (don't implement the actions still!)
  
## Part 2
The second part of the implementation will be to create appropriate Actions in the Order Controller for:
  * Create
  * Edit
  * Details

Taking that into consideration, you will need to create appropriate Views for each method.
