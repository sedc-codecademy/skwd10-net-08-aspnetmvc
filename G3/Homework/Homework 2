# Addition to Pizza App üçï

## Part 1
The first part of the addition of Pizza App will be to create a 'Details' action in the Order Controller to retrieve information about one order based on the id, and to 
create a corresponding View for that action. 

## Part 2
Create a Partial View and implement it in the created View from Part 1 (try to use the partial tag for resolving this instead of using Html tag).
