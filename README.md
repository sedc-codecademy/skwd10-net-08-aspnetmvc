# Welcome to Developing ASP.NET Web Applications ðŸš€

This course would be a combination of almost all knowledge gathered throughout this academy year. Throughout this 10-module course, we will cover the concepts of building full end-to-end web applications including front-end, back-end, and a database. This subject is one of the more advanced subjects in the academy and it will require prior knowledge in many cases. Since it's an advanced subject, you might feel overwhelmed at times, but remember to just keep writing code, solve problems, find solutions, and tackle issues so that you can set a good foundation and good working habits and practices. Hope you have fun and good luck ðŸ˜‰
